What is Sass?

Sass stands for Syntactically Awesome Stylesheet
Sass is an extension to CSS
Sass is a CSS pre-processor
Sass is completely compatible with all versions of CSS
Sass reduces repetition of CSS and therefore saves time
Sass was designed by Hampton Catlin and developed by Natalie Weizenbaum in 2006
Sass is free to download and use

Why Use Sass?

Stylesheets are getting larger, more complex, and harder to maintain. This is where a CSS pre-processor can help.

Sass lets you use features that do not exist in CSS, like variables, nested rules, mixins, imports, inheritance, built-in functions, and other stuff.

How Does Sass Work?

A browser does not understand Sass code. Therefore, you will need a Sass pre-processor to convert Sass code into standard CSS.

This process is called transpiling. So, you need to give a transpiler (some kind of program) some Sass code and then get some CSS code back.


benfits

create a index folder for html
then create scss folder inside it create a scss file  (file-name.scss)
write your code in scss file 
and then when you install live saas compiler externsion
in the bottom of vs code  new option will start showing - watch saas
so click on the watch saas
when it start showing watching
means now scss is working 
and then and it will direcly create a css file and css.map file and scss file code is directly copy to css file
so using live server se your html file


Note:

live compilation of sccs is showing in terminal 
so if there is a little mistake in sccs file , our css will not work
its like doing DSA , having semicolon issue will effect entire code file
